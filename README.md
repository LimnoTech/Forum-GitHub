# Forum-GitHub
## A collaboratively developed and hands-on introduction to Git &amp; GitHub for LimnoTech staff.

Steve's initial brainstormed outline, but just ideas:

* What is version control? 
* What is Git?
* Basic Git commands and vocabulary
* What is GitHub? Pushing, pulling, cloning from GitHub.
* Examples of projects on GitHub.
* What we can use it for
* End with "homework" to add to a GitHub project. Have people download. Maybe write a story as a group?
