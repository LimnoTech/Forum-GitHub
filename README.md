# An Intro to Git & GitHub for Version Control & Collaboration
**A Hands-on Forum Presentation to LimnoTech Staff**
**By Anthony Aufdenkampe & Steve Skripnik**

####Abstract:
Git is a modern version control system used by software engineers, and GitHub has become a predominant platform enabling teams to collaboratively develop assemblages of text-based documents and to publish open-source code. This hands-on forum is designed to demonstrate a number of different workflows using Git & GitHub that could be valuable to a broad range of LimnoTech staff, including managing model input files for different scearios on solo projects. Bring your laptop and feel free to [Get Started](https://github.com/LimnoTech/Forum-GitHub#get-started) (see below) before you arrive.


####Outline:
* Intro to version control, Git and GitHub (Anthony)
* Basic Git commands and vocabulary (Steve)
  * Commit, sync, push, pull, clone, fork, pull request
  * Show concept, then demonstrate fork/clone, branch, commit, pull request
* Examples of different GitHub projects & workflows (Anthony)
* What we can use it for at LimnoTech (Steve)
  * Individual/Colaborative coding projects
  * Individual/Collaborative writing (like this document)
  * Anything that would benefit from text version control
    * Model input files
    * Text documents
      * to do lists
      * configuration files
      * ...anything you'd like to save versions of
* End with "homework" to add to a GitHub project (Steve)
  * Will create a new repository with a story to edit
  * Fork project
  * Add commit
  * New pull request
  * see it updated
  * Do this once during the presentation

####Get Started:
1. Create a free personal GitHub account: [https://github.com/pricing​](https://github.com/pricing)
  * ​Email your username to Anthony, Tad or Todd, and we'll add you as members of the [LimnoTech Github organization](https://github.com/LimnoTech​). Once you are a member, go to People and change your visibility to Public. The LimnoTech logo will now be connected to your personal account and you will be able to see & create the LimnoTech's private respositories.

2. Install GitHub Desktop: [https://desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)
  * This is a great way to get started because it installs the Git command line tools in addition to a very easy to use GUI desktop application. A lot of programmers only use the command line tools, because it does allow for some additional functions, but the Desktop application is a great way to get started.
  * Sign into your GitHub account
  * Learn: [https://help.github.com/desktop/](https://help.github.com/desktop/)

3. Learn about Git version control
  * [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) is a great place to get started with learning new computational skills, including Git: [http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

4. Enable Git in RStudio and connect to your GitHub account
  * ​Follow these instructions: [https://www.r-bloggers.com/rstudio-and-github/​](https://www.r-bloggers.com/rstudio-and-github/)
  * This setup allows you to have both RStudio and GitHub Desktop connected to the same instance of Git on your local machine, with the additional ability to interact/sync with repositories on GitHub.
